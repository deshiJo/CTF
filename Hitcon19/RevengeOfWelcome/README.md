#Revenge of Welcome

In this challange we can't use <ESC> to get into _normal mode_.
But we can reach normal mode or _command mode_ from _insert mode_ without esc: 
"Entered when CTRL-O given in Insert mode. This is like Normal mode, but after executing one command Vim returns to Insert mode."[link](vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/intro.html)

To use a command type **CTRL-O**, **v** then **:** and remove all symboles but **:** and append **!/bin/bash** to get a shell or only append **!cat flag** to get the flag:
**hitcon{accidentally enter vim -y and can't leave Q_Q}**
